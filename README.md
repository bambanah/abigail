# Welcome to Abigail

### ðŸ’² The Be-All and End-All of Personal Finance Calculators

I got a bit sick of maintaining a massively sprawling spreadsheet for figuring out my personal finance situation, so I decided to create **Abigail**. Abigail is a personal finance tool to give you an extremely in-depth overview into your finances.

My eventual goal for Abigail is for it to be able to sync with your life, give you an accurate overview of where all your money is going, and most importantly, help you find ways to make the most of it.

It's still in its very early stages, but it's already proving useful to me.
